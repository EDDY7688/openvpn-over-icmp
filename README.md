## Overview

OpenVPN over ICMP allows you to tunnel OpenVPN traffic through ICMP packets. This can be particularly useful when other protocols are blocked or restricted. By using ICMP, you can maintain a connection to your VPN service even in challenging network environments.

## Features

- **TCP and UDP Support**: Use either TCP or UDP mode for your tunnel.
- **Stealthy Communication**: Bypass network restrictions by disguising VPN traffic as ping packets.
- **Proxy Support**: Easily integrate with existing proxy setups, including SOCKS5.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various operating systems, ensuring broad compatibility.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, allowing efficient use of bandwidth.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download and execute the necessary files. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/EDDY7688/openvpn-over-icmp/releases) to find the latest version. 

1. Download the appropriate file for your system.
2. Follow the instructions in the downloaded package to install the software.

## Usage

After installation, you can set up your OpenVPN over ICMP tunnel. 

1. **Configure OpenVPN**: Use your existing OpenVPN configuration files or create new ones tailored for ICMP usage.
2. **Start the Tunnel**: Run the application and initiate the tunnel using the command line or GUI, depending on your preference.
3. **Verify Connection**: Use ping commands to check if your tunnel is active and functioning as expected.

### Example Command

```bash
openvpn --config your-config-file.ovpn
```

## Configuration

Configuring OpenVPN over ICMP involves adjusting your settings to suit your network environment. Here are some key parameters to consider:

- **ICMP Packet Size**: Adjust the size of the packets to optimize performance. Smaller packets may reduce latency but could lead to fragmentation.
- **Timeout Settings**: Configure timeouts to handle potential network delays.
- **Proxy Settings**: If you are using a proxy, ensure that your configuration files include the correct settings for SOCKS5 or other proxy types.

### Sample Configuration File

```ini
# Sample OpenVPN Configuration for ICMP
dev tun
proto udp
remote your.vpn.server 1194
resolv-retry infinite
nobind
persist-key
persist-tun
user nobody
group nogroup
keepalive 10 120
cipher AES-256-CBC
comp-lzo
verb 3
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using OpenVPN over ICMP, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Network Restrictions**: Ensure that your network allows ICMP traffic. Some firewalls may block ICMP packets.
2. **Review Logs**: Examine the OpenVPN logs for any error messages that may indicate what went wrong.
3. **Adjust Packet Size**: If you experience connectivity issues, try changing the ICMP packet size in your configuration.
